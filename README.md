## Assignment:        

Create a small Hangman game only with DOM manipulation without a backend.

### Making Guesses
* Build a grid of letters that are clickable.
* To make a guess, a user must click a letter in the grid.
* Clicking a letter selects it. Changing its appearance.

### Correct Guesses
* Display a list of empty horizontal bars below the letter grid.
* There should be one for every letter in the mystery word.
* Given a mystery word of "stranger", it would appear as such:
* As the user makes correct guesses, display the letters that were tried successfully.

### Incorrect Guesses
* As the user makes incorrect guesses, "draw" more body parts of the hanged stick figure on the gallows.

### Ending the Game
* When the user guesses correctly, play a victory sound of your choice and display an alert.
* If the user guesses incorrectly and runs out of guesses, play a failure sound and display an alert to that effect.

### Stretches
* Once a user completes a word, begin a new round with a randomly chosen mystery word.
* Allow the user to input their guesses by pressing letters on their keyboard instead.
